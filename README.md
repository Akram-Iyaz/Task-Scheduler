# Task-Scheduler
This is the command line based python app which executes a specific command at any given time.

# How it works
It only runs on Linux, and uses python to function.

# How to Schedule a task.
1.  Run the program from terminal or as you run any other Python Program.
2.  It will ask for what command you want to execute.
3.  And then input the time in (24 hours format) with "Seconds" or you can put 00 in seconds place.
4.  The Time will be in (HH:MM:SS) format.
5.  Don't Put any Colon(:) between the Hours,Minutes and Seconds. Python will automatically add them 
    example for time (12:15:00) just put only (121500).
